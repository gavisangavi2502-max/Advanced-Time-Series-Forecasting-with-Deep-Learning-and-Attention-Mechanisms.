# Attention Interpretation (placeholder)
This file should be populated with concrete analysis after running the experiments.
Suggestions:
- Load saved attention weights (`outputs/att_split_*.npy`) and plot the average attention across examples.
- Compare attention peaks with known seasonality or structural breaks in the series.
- Show a few example sequences: input, attention over time, and predicted horizon.
- Discuss whether attention aligns with interpretable features (lags, seasonal period).
